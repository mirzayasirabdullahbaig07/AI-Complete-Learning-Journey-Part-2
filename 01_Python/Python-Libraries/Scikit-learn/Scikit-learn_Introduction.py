# =======================================
# ü§ñ What is Scikit-learn in Python?
# =======================================

# Scikit-learn (also known as sklearn) is one of the most popular and powerful
# open-source machine learning libraries in Python.

# It is built on top of core scientific libraries:
# - NumPy     ‚Üí for numerical operations
# - SciPy     ‚Üí for scientific computing
# - Matplotlib ‚Üí for plotting and visualizations (used internally)

# ==========================================
# üìå What Can You Do with Scikit-learn?
# ==========================================

# Scikit-learn provides simple and efficient tools for:
# - Classification (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, KNN)
# - Regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
# - Clustering (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN)
# - Preprocessing (e.g., StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder)
# - Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)
# - Outlier Detection (e.g., Isolation Forest)
# - Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, AdaBoost)
# - Model Evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)

# ==========================================
# üéØ Core Focus of Scikit-learn
# ==========================================

# Scikit-learn primarily focuses on **data modeling**, not data loading or visualization.
# It provides consistent APIs to train, test, and evaluate models efficiently.

# ============================
# üß† Main Types of Algorithms
# ============================

# üîπ Supervised Learning Algorithms:
#    - Algorithms trained on labeled data
#    - Examples:
#       * Linear Regression
#       * Logistic Regression
#       * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
#       * Decision Trees and Random Forests
#       * k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#       * Naive Bayes

# üîπ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:
#    - Algorithms trained on unlabeled data
#    - Examples:
#       * K-Means Clustering
#       * DBSCAN
#       * Hierarchical Clustering
#       * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
#       * t-SNE

# üîπ Semi-supervised and Reinforcement Learning:
#    - Not the main focus of scikit-learn (for these, use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch)

# ==========================
# ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features of sklearn
# ==========================

# - Easy-to-use and consistent API
# - Extensive documentation and examples
# - Integration with pipelines and cross-validation tools
# - Built-in datasets for practice (e.g., iris, digits, Boston housing)
# - Plug-and-play with NumPy/Pandas arrays

# ===========================================
# ‚úÖ Summary:
# ===========================================

# Scikit-learn is an essential library for ML practitioners.
# It's ideal for prototyping models, evaluating performance, and working with structured data.

# For deep learning, use TensorFlow or PyTorch.
# For model deployment, consider using joblib or pickle to save sklearn models.
