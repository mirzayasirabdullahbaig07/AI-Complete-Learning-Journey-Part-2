# üìä Matplotlib Notes (with Python Examples)

This folder contains **Matplotlib tutorials with Python code** to visualize data in different formats.  
Visualization is a **key step in Data Science and Machine Learning** for understanding and presenting data effectively.

---

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. 2D Plots (`01_Matplotlib_2D_Plots.py`)
- Basic line plots in 2D.  
- Customizing axes, labels, titles.  
- First step to learning Matplotlib.

---

### 2. Scatter Plot (`02_Matplotlib_Scatter_plot.py`)
- Represents relationship between **two variables**.  
- Helps identify trends, clusters, and outliers.  
- Example: Age vs Salary plot.

---

### 3. Bar Chart (`03_Matplotlib_Barchart.py`)
- Used to compare **categories**.  
- Horizontal & vertical bars.  
- Example: Sales per product.

---

### 4. Histogram (`04_Matplotlib_Histogram.py`)
- Shows **frequency distribution** of data.  
- Useful for understanding data spread and skewness.  
- Example: Student test scores distribution.

---

### 5. Pie Chart (`05_Matplotlib_Piechart.py`)
- Represents data in **percentages of a whole**.  
- Example: Market share of different companies.  
- Can add labels, percentages, and explode effects.

---

### 6. Colored Plot (`06_Matplotlib_Colored_Plot.py`)
- Using colors to enhance plots.  
- Custom colormaps for better visual appeal.  
- Helps in distinguishing multiple datasets.

---

### 7. Annotation (`07_Matplotlib_Annotation.py`)
- Adding text, arrows, and highlights to plots.  
- Useful for explaining important points in visualizations.  

---

### 8. Subplots (`08_Matplotlib_Subplots.py`)
- Displaying multiple plots in a single figure.  
- Compare datasets side by side.  
- Example: Line plot + Histogram together.

---

### 9. 3D Scatter Plot (`09_Matplotlib_3D_Scatter_plot.py`)
- Visualizing data in **three dimensions**.  
- Useful for datasets with three features.  
- Example: Height vs Weight vs Age.

---

### 10. Pandas Plotting (`10_Pandas_Plot.py`)
- Using **Pandas built-in plotting** (which uses Matplotlib under the hood).  
- Quick visualization of DataFrames.  
- Example: Plotting time-series data directly from a DataFrame.

---

### üìÇ Dataset Folder
- `Matplotlib_Datasets/` contains sample datasets used in plotting examples.

---

## üèÜ Why Learn Matplotlib?
- Core Python library for **data visualization**.  
- Foundation for advanced libraries like **Seaborn, Plotly, Altair**.  
- Helps in EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), ML results visualization, and reports.
