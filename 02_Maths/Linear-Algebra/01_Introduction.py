# 📘 What is this course all about?
# This course is a 4-week journey into Linear Algebra for Machine Learning.
# You will learn the basics of matrices, vectors, systems of equations, and their applications in ML.
# 
# 🧮 Matrices & Vectors:
# - A matrix is like a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
# - A vector is a list of numbers, which can represent a point or direction in space.
#
# 📊 Systems of Equations:
# - A system of equations is a set of multiple equations that we solve together.
# - Example: 
#   2x + 7 = 17
#   Solving this gives x = 5
#
# ✏️ Solving Equations:
# - You will learn how to solve simple equations with one unknown variable (like x).
# - This is the foundation for solving more complex systems with multiple variables.
#
# 📈 Plotting Functions:
# - You will also learn how to represent equations visually on a coordinate system.
# - Example: The function y = x
#   If you plot this in the plane:
#   - It passes through the origin (0,0).
#   - It forms a diagonal line at a 45-degree angle upwards.
#
# ✅ Why this matters:
# These basics of Linear Algebra (matrices, vectors, and systems of equations)
# are building blocks for understanding more advanced topics like 
# Gaussian elimination, eigenvalues, PCA, and how neural networks work.
