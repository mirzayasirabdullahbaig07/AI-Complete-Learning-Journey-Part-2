# üìä Statistics Notes (with Python Examples)

This folder contains **step-by-step notes with Python examples** to learn Statistics for **Machine Learning and Data Science**.  
Each file explains an important statistical concept with clear comments and examples.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Statistics (`01_Statistic_Introduction.py`)
- What is statistics?  
- Types: Descriptive vs Inferential statistics.  
- Why statistics is important in Machine Learning.

---

### 2. Five Number Summary (`02_Five_Number_Summary.py`)
- Minimum, Q1 (25th percentile), Median (Q2), Q3 (75th percentile), Maximum.  
- Used to describe the spread of data.  
- Foundation for boxplots.

---

### 3. Boxplot (`03_Boxplot.py`)
- Visual representation of the Five Number Summary.  
- Identifies **outliers** and shows data distribution.  
- Useful for quick EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

---

### 4. Scatterplot (`04_Scatterplot.py`)
- A graph showing relationship between **two variables**.  
- Helps detect correlations, trends, and clusters.  
- Commonly used in regression analysis.

---

### 5. Covariance (`05_Covariance_Statistics.py`)
- Measures how two variables vary together.  
- Positive covariance ‚Üí variables increase together.  
- Negative covariance ‚Üí one increases while the other decreases.

---

### 6. Correlation (`06_Correlation_Statistics.py`)
- Standardized version of covariance.  
- Values range from **-1 to +1**.  
- +1 ‚Üí strong positive relationship  
- -1 ‚Üí strong negative relationship  
- 0 ‚Üí no relationship.

---

### 7. Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) (`07_Probability_Distribution_Functions_Statistics.py`)
- Functions that describe the likelihood of values of a random variable.  
- Example: Normal Distribution, Uniform Distribution.  
- Basis for statistical inference in ML.

---

### 8. Normal Distribution (`08_Normal_Distribution_Functions_Statistics.py`)
- The famous **bell curve**.  
- Most real-world data follows this distribution.  
- Mean = Median = Mode.  
- Crucial in hypothesis testing and ML algorithms.

---

### 9. Non-Gaussian Distributions (`09_Non-Gaussian_Probability_Distributions_Statistics.py`)
- Distributions that do not follow the bell curve.  
- Examples: Exponential, Poisson, Binomial.  
- Important in cases where data is skewed or discrete.

---

## üèÜ Why Learn Statistics?
- Statistics is the **foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning**.  
- Helps understand data, relationships, and uncertainty.  
- Powers ML methods like **linear regression, hypothesis testing, feature selection, and probabilistic models**.
